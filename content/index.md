## Welcome to PDNS Manager

PDNS Manager is a simple yet powerful administration tool for the
Powerdns authoritative nameserver. It currently only supports master zones.

PNDS Manager was developed from scratch to achieve a user-friendly
and pretty looking interface.

PDNS Manager also features a powerful API to set records programatically.
This can be used e.g. for a dynamic DNS service, but also to obtain certificates
from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) via the dns-01 challenge.

PDNS Manager is written in PHP using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). The backend uses a MySQL or Maria DB
database. The database is also used by Powerdns using the pdns-backend-mysql.
