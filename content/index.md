## Welcome to PDNS Manager

PDNS Manager is a simple yet powerfull administration tool for the
Powerdns authoritative Nameserver. It currently supports master zones.

PNDS Manager is a complete new development for achieving a user-friendly
and pretty looking interface.

PDNS Manager features also a powerfull
API for setting records programatically which can be used for a dynamic
DNS Service but also can be used for obtaining certificates from
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) via the dns-01 challenge.

PDNS Manager is written in PHP using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). The backend uses a MySQL or Maria DB
database. The database is also used by Powerdns using the pdns-backend-mysql.
